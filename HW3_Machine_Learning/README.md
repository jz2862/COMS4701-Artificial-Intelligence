# Homework 3: Machine Learning

## Introduction

Three small and separate machine learning models.
I. Perceptron
II. Linear Regression
III. Clustering

## I. Perceptron

Implement the perceptron learning algorithm (PLA) for a linearly separable dataset. 

**Usage:**

```
python problem1.py input1.csv output1.csv
```



## II. Linear Regression

Use gradient descent to build a linear regression model for predicting height (m) using age (yr) and weight
(kg), using data derived from CDC growth charts data.

**Usage:**

```
python problem2.py input2.csv output2.csv
```




## II. Linear Regression$ 


## III. Clustering

Implements the following two clustering algorithms:

*  K-means
* Spectral Clustering

on the given image trees.png. Segment and group the pixels according to their RGB values.
